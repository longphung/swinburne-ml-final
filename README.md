# Swinburne Machine Learning Final Project - Team 7

Repo for hosting Swinburne's machine learning final assignment. Git LFS is temporarily opened with max 1Gb bandwidth and max size, which will be removed later on.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```

2. Configure Git LFS:

- Follow instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage

## Project Structure

We have 2 tasks, so I created 2 subfolders, DeepLearningModels and MachineLearningModels. Each subfolder will contain the code for the respective task:

```
.
├── MachineLearningModels
├── DeepLearningModels
```

## Contribution

1. Create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b <branch-name>
```

2. Make changes and commit:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "commit message"
```

3. Push changes:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

4. Create a pull request on GitHub.
